      <p className="leading-7 text-justify">
        I{"'"}m Leonardo, a front-end developer with 15 years of experience (and
        counting). I{"'"}ve dedicated the past years to deliver scalable and
        reliant interfaces utilising cutting-edge front-end technologies and
        best practices. In the past 5 years, I{"'"}ve called Amsterdam home,
        drawing inspiration from its vibrant culture and diverse design
        aesthetics. I stay on the cutting edge of web technologies, constantly
        learning and implementing the latest trends and best practices. When I
        {"'"}m not coding, I enjoy exploring the city, immersing myself in its
        artistic scene, and networking with fellow developers at tech meetups.
